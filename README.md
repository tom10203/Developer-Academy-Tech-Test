# Developer-Academy-Tech-Test

Prerequisites:
Python, Numpy


Please find a python script for the entry test into game development bootcamp.
Comments are left within the script.
I have also manually inputted the data from the points table - so if you run the script via terminal, you are able to enter row number (starting at 1), width and height of cone, and the script will output the results.
